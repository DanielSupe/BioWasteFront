This waste, made up of materials such as foodscraps, paper and cardboard, has the ability to decompose naturally and be reintegrated into thecycle of life without leaving a negative impact on the environment. The BioWaste project emergesas an innovative solution to address this critical challenge.","BioWaste is an interactive web platform designed specifically for tenants of a residential building.Its main objective is to serve as an educational and management tool, with the purpose ofimproving recycling practices and the proper management of biodegradable waste. Through thisplatform, we seek to create and implement a comprehensive system that not only optimizesrecycling processes, but also promotes environmental awareness and active communityparticipation.","To achieve this ambitious goal, BioWaste has a series of carefully designed specific objectives. First,a secure database will be developed that registers all tenants and allows individualized monitoringof their recycling practices. This will allow recommendations and educational content to bepersonalized for each tenant.","In addition, a personalized login system will be implemented that will provide access toeducational content and recommendations adapted to the specific needs of each user. Thispersonalized approach will increase the platform's effectiveness by addressing the unique concernsand challenges tenants face.","One of the most innovative aspects of BioWaste is the design and integration of interactive andrecreational activities. These activities are designed to promote awareness and active participationin the recycling of biodegradable waste, turning the process into an educational and entertainingexperience for all users.","To further motivate tenants to continually improve their recycling habits, BioWaste will establish arewards or incentive system. This system will recognize and reward the efforts of the mostcommitted tenants, thus fostering a culture of environmental responsibility within the community.","In addition to these features, BioWaste will constantly evaluate its impact on reducingbiodegradable waste and improving recycling practices in the building. This will allow the platformto be adjusted and optimized to guarantee tangible and measurable results","One of the highlights of BioWaste is its ability to foster collaboration and a sense of communityamong tenants. Through group challenges and collective recycling projects, the platform willencourage active participation and teamwork, creating an environment of mutual support andshared responsibility.","The BioWaste project is based on several essential theoretical concepts that support theimportance and need to implement sustainable practices in the management of biodegradablewaste. Among these concepts are environmental sustainability, the circular economy, the 3 Rs(Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), composting and current legal regulations","To ensure reliable and measurable results, BioWaste will follow a rigorous methodology that willcombine qualitative and quantitative approaches. An applied and descriptive research will becarried out, with a non-experimental and transversal design. The study population will be made upof all tenants in the building, and all available tenants will be included in a census sample. Datacollection techniques will include surveys, interviews, platform data analysis, and directobservation.","Through the implementation of BioWaste, a series of significant results are expected to beachieved. Firstly, a notable reduction in the generation of biodegradable waste by tenants isexpected, thanks to the implementation of reduction and recycling practices promoted by theplatform. In addition, a substantial improvement is expected in the efficiency and effectiveness ofwaste separation at the source, which will facilitate its subsequent treatment and recycling.","Another key result is the expected increase in the composting rate of organic waste. A greaternumber of tenants will participate in composting activities, thus contributing to the conversion ofthis waste into natural fertilizer for the green areas of the building or the community.","Beyond quantifiable results, BioWaste aims to create a positive change in tenants' environmentalawareness and behavior. This change will be reflected in the periodic surveys and evaluationscarried out throughout the project.","Finally, BioWaste will foster a strengthened sense of community and collaboration among tenants.By participating in collective waste management challenges and projects, tenants will develop asense of belonging and shared responsibility towards caring for the environment.","In summary, the BioWaste project represents an innovative and comprehensive initiative thatseeks to address the critical challenge of managing biodegradable waste in a residential context. Bycombining an interactive web platform with educational and community engagement approaches,BioWaste has the potential to make a significant impact in reducing carbon footprint andpromoting sustainable practices. This project will not only improve the management ofbiodegradable waste, but will also foster greater environmental awareness and a sense of sharedresponsibility among the building's tenants, thus contributing to the construction of a moresustainable community committed to protecting the environment."]
